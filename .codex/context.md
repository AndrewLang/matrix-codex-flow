
You are working on CodexFlow, a Tauri + Angular + Tailwind desktop app.

Project Rules (must follow):
- No comments unless required by the framework to function
- Clean code, no magic strings/numbers (use constants)
- Full words for naming, no abbreviations
- Angular: use inject() for DI, Signals first
- Strict typing, no any
- Lazy loading: use loadComponent for all new components
- Use '.' separator for file names (e.g. task.chain.editor.component.ts)

UI goals:
- Beautiful, modern chat UI similar to Codex / ChatGPT
- Smooth layout, glassy panels, subtle borders, nice spacing
- Mobile-friendly and desktop-friendly

Output requirements:
- Provide complete code changes
- Keep changes small and incremental
- Ensure the app builds
